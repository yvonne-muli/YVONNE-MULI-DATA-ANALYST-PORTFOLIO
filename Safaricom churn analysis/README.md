# 📉 Safaricom Customer Churn Analysis

### 📘 Overview
This project analyzes Safaricom’s customer data to identify key factors influencing churn.  
The goal was to understand which customer segments are more likely to leave and what patterns drive customer retention.  

The analysis was done using *Excel* for data cleaning and *Power BI* for creating interactive dashboards and visuals.

---

### 🧰 Tools Used
- *Excel* — for cleaning, organizing, and preparing the dataset  
- *Power BI* — for building visual dashboards and analyzing churn metrics  

---

### 🧪 Process

1. *Data Cleaning (Excel)*
   - Removed duplicates and blank rows  
   - Standardized column names and data formats  
   - Created calculated columns for churn indicators and tenure categories  

2. *Visualization & Analysis (Power BI)*
   - Imported the cleaned dataset into Power BI  
   - Created DAX measures for churn rate and average data usage  
   - Designed visuals showing churn by:
     - Gender  
     - Region  
     - Tenure (months)  
     - Age group  
     - Average data usage  

---

### 📈 Key Insights

- *Churn by Gender:* Slightly higher churn among female customers  
- *Churn by Region:* Certain regions have consistently higher churn, suggesting local service or competition issues  
- *Churn by Tenure:* Newer customers (under 6 months) churn more frequently  
- *Average Data Usage:* Lower average data usage is linked with higher churn  
- *Age Group:* Younger customers tend to churn more, possibly due to price sensitivity  

---

### 💡 Recommendations

- Implement *retention campaigns* focused on new and young customers  
- Offer *regional loyalty programs* or targeted promotions in high-churn areas  
- Encourage *data bundle usage* with personalized offers to improve engagement

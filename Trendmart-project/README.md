# 🛒 TrendMart Database Project

## 📖 Overview
TrendMart is a simulated retail database designed to analyze customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.  
The project demonstrates database design, SQL querying, and data visualization skills using tools like *Supabase, **Excel, and **Power BI*.

## 🧱 Database Structure
The database contains *three main tables* with a *foreign key relationship*:

1. *Customers* – stores customer details such as name, email, gender, and location.  
2. *Products* – contains product information including category, price, and stock levels.  
3. *sales* – records each transaction, linking customers to products and tracking order dates and amounts.
